## Knowledge-Based Systems

Welcome to the GitHub space of the research group [Knowledge-Based Systems](https://kbs.inf.tu-dresden.de) (KBS) at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/)!
We are using this space for
- Our research software projects (obviously)
- Evaluation data and background resources for publications
- Source files for teaching materials (pull requests from students are welcome!)

### About KBS

The research group [Knowledge-Based Systems](https://kbs.inf.tu-dresden.de) is concerned with methods for the intelligent
management and processing of information in computer systems. This includes research questions
from knowledge representation, reasoning and formal logic, but also covers topics related to
databases and distributed systems. Important application areas of this research can be found
in the fields of semantic technologies, artificial intelligence, and knowledge management.
